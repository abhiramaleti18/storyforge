EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are extracting structured facts from a chapter of fiction for a
continuity-tracking system. Read the text and extract every concrete, checkable fact about
characters, locations, items, and events: physical descriptions, relationships, status
(alive/dead/injured), locations, dates/time references, and stated events.

Only extract facts that are explicitly stated or very strongly implied — do not infer
beyond what the text supports. Include a short exact quote for each fact so it can be
cited later. Always refer to a character by their fullest name as used in this text — never
use a pronoun (he, she, they...) as the entity; work out who it refers to instead.

Two things are easy to miss, so check for them:
- Objects: when an object is used, moved, lost, thrown away or destroyed, write the object's
  name in the fact (never just "it"), and also add a fact about the object itself, in the form
  "<object> | location | <where it now is>".
- Time: record every day, date or time the text gives for an event, including passing
  references. The entity is always the EVENT, never the day itself: "<event> | day | <day>".
  Only record a day, date, age or number that is actually written in the text. Never guess one.

Also list every RELATIONSHIP between two characters that the text states: family (parent,
child, spouse, sibling, cousin, grandparent...) and other ties (friend, ally, rival, enemy,
mentor, apprentice, employer, servant, lover). Write it as "person | relation | other_person",
read as "person is the <relation> of other_person", using both characters' fullest names.

Only extract facts from the Chapter text section below.
